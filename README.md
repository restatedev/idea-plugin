## TODO

* auto magic association of the plugin when you download the example from CLI (suggest plugin feature)
* Make it work for golang
* Figure out when the user starts the service without starting the runtime yet, and add a button to start the runtime
* Tweak the readme to adapt it to the plugin experience
